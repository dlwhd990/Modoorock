모든 데이터는 소멸됩니다. 다만, 엔터프라이즈 버전의 “서비스”에 “고객”이 등록한 연락처 정보는 “사업자” 단위의 업무 관련 연락처 관리 서비스로써 “고객”이 “서비스”를 해지하여도 “고객”이 소속된 “사업자”의 정보로 관리되어 소멸되지 않습니다.\n5) “회사”는 “고객”이 본 약관에서 정한 의무를 위반할 경우 서면, 이메일, 전화, 기타 방법을 통하여

않습니다.\n4) 월간요금제 대비 할인받은 금액은 연간 계약시 체결한 월 청구금액 기준으로 계산되며, 남은기간 동안 지불할 금액의 10%는 서비스 탈퇴 신청일로부터 이전 30일동안 최대 사용인원 기준으로 계산됩니다.\n5) 위약금 계산 공식은 아래와 같습니다. \n(1) 월간 요금제 대비 할인받은 금액 = {사용기간 월 X (월간요금제월요금 -

인하여 발생하는 손해에 대하여 “회사”는 어떠한 책임도 부담하지 않습니다.\n3) “회사”는 “고객” 상호간, “고객”과 제휴사 또는 제3자 상호간에 “서비스”를 매개로 발생한 분쟁에 대해서는 개입할 의무가 없으며 이로 인한 손해를 배상할 책임이 없습니다.\n제 19조 (지식재산권 등)\n1) 본 약관을 통해 “회사”는 “고객”에게 “서비스”에 대한 사용권만을 부여하며, “회사”가 작성하여 제공하는 “서비스”에 관한 소유권 및 지식재산권은 “회사”에 귀속됩니다. 단, “서비스” 중 “회사”와 제휴를 통해 제휴사가 제공하는 “서비스”에 대한 소유권 및 지식재산권은 제휴사에 귀속됩니다.\n2) “고객”은 “회사”가 제공하는 “서비스”를 “회사”의 사전 동의 없이 영리 목적으로 복제, 전송, 출판, 배포,

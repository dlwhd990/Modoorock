“회사”측에 문의절차를 통해서 알리고 “회사”가 해지과정을 진행합니다.\n3) 탈퇴 신청의 처리 여부는 “고객”이 “식별수단”을 사용하여 로그인을 시도하여 로그인이 되지 않음을 확인함으로써 알 수 있습니다.\n4) “고객”이 “서비스”를 해지할 경우, 관련법령 및 개인정보취급방침에 따라 “회사”가 회원정보를 보유하는 경우를 제외하고는 해지 즉시 “고객”의 모든 데이터는 소멸됩니다. 다만, 엔터프라이즈 버전의 “서비스”에 “고객”이 등록한 연락처 정보는 “사업자” 단위의 업무 관련 연락처 관리 서비스로써 “고객”이 “서비스”를 해지하여도 “고객”이 소속된 “사업자”의 정보로 관리되어 소멸되지 않습니다.\n5) “회사”는 “고객”이 본 약관에서 정한 의무를 위반할 경우 서면, 이메일, 전화, 기타 방법을 통하여 그 시정 또는 개선을 요구할 수 있고, 귀책 당사자의 시정 또는 개선 조치가 없을 경우 서면, 이메일, 전화, 기타 방법을 통하여 통지한 후 “서비스”의 제공을 중지할 수 있습니다.\n6) “회사”는 “고객”에게 다음 어느 하나에 해당하는 상황이 발생 할 경우 사전 통보 없이 “서비스”의 제공을 중지할 수 있습니다.\n가. 금융기관의 지급거절, 해산,

않습니다.\n4) 월간요금제 대비 할인받은 금액은 연간 계약시 체결한 월 청구금액 기준으로 계산되며, 남은기간 동안 지불할 금액의 10%는 서비스 탈퇴 신청일로부터 이전 30일동안 최대 사용인원 기준으로 계산됩니다.\n5) 위약금 계산 공식은 아래와 같습니다. \n(1) 월간 요금제 대비 할인받은 금액 = {사용기간 월 X (월간요금제월요금 - 연간요금제월요금)}\n(2) 남은 기간 동안 지불할 금액의 10% = {월 계약금액 X (총계약기간 월-사용기간 월)+(추가사용인원 사용금액)} X 10%\n(3) 위약금 = (1) + (2) \n6) “엔터프라이즈” 요금제의 경우 정해진 요금제를 따르는 것이 아니라, “상담 및 견적요청”에 의거한 “견적서”와 정식 “계약문서”에 의해서 결정됩니다.\n7)

의견이나 불만이 정당한 것으로 인정될 경우 신속히 처리하여야 합니다. 다만, 신속한 처리가 곤란한 경우 “고객”에게 그 사유와 처리 일정을 이메일, 서면 또는 전화 등의 방법으로 통지합니다. \n제 16조 (고객의 의무)\n1) “고객”은 본 약관 및 관계 법령을 준수하여야 하며, 기타 회사의 업무 수행에 지장을 초래하는 행위를 하여서는 안됩니다.\n2)

국가비상사태, 천재지변, 기간통신사업자의 서비스제공 중단, 한전으로부터의 전력공급 중단, 해커의 침입, 컴퓨터 바이러스, 기타 이와 유사한 사정으로 인한 서비스 시스템의 작동불능 등 불가항력으로 인하여 “서비스”를 제공할 수 없는 경우 “회사”는 제공하는 “서비스”의 이용과 관련하여 어떠한 책임도 부담하지 않습니다.\n2) “회사”는 “고객”의 귀책사유로 인하여 발생하는 손해에 대하여 “회사”는 어떠한 책임도 부담하지 않습니다.\n3) “회사”는 “고객” 상호간, “고객”과 제휴사 또는 제3자 상호간에 “서비스”를 매개로 발생한 분쟁에 대해서는 개입할 의무가 없으며 이로 인한 손해를 배상할 책임이 없습니다.\n제 19조 (지식재산권 등)\n1) 본 약관을 통해 “회사”는 “고객”에게 “서비스”에 대한 사용권만을 부여하며, “회사”가 작성하여 제공하는 “서비스”에 관한 소유권 및 지식재산권은 “회사”에 귀속됩니다. 단, “서비스” 중 “회사”와 제휴를 통해 제휴사가 제공하는 “서비스”에 대한 소유권 및 지식재산권은 제휴사에 귀속됩니다.\n2) “고객”은 “회사”가 제공하는 “서비스”를 “회사”의 사전 동의 없이 영리 목적으로 복제, 전송, 출판, 배포,
